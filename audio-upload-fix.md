## Audio Upload Fix Summary

**Problem:** Audio uploads were failing with empty audioApiUrl

**Root Cause:** AUDIO_API_ENDPOINT was missing from .env file

**Solution:**
1. Added AUDIO_API_ENDPOINT=https://1oj6yn09u4.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/audio to .env
2. Ran step-25-update-web-files.sh to regenerate audio.html
3. CloudFront cache invalidated

**Status:** Fixed - deployed to https://dxl3csiag85e6.cloudfront.net/audio.html

**Action Required:**
- Wait 1-2 minutes for CloudFront cache to clear
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Try recording again - uploads should now work\!
